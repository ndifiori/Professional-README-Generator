# Professional-README-Generator
Bootcamp Challenge 9

## Your Task

For this challenge, I utilized node.js including inquirer and path to create a Professional README Generator. The README Generator asks the users questions, stores their answers, and repopulates the answers with the help of inquirer into a Javascript file. This allows us to use node.js file system to write a new README file with personalized user answers.

## Preview
